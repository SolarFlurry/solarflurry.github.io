		<p>Minecraft Bedrock addons compiler for ease of development.</p>
		<br />
		<p>Zircon was made as a (worse) alternative to <span><a href="https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith/"
					target="_blank">Regolith</a></span> as I could not download it (for several reasons).
			Most of my Minecraft Addons now uses Zircon, however it will only be updating to keep up with Minecraft
			versions.</p>
